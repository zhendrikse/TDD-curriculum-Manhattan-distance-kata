# Manhattan Distance
[Manhattan distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance) is the distance between two points in a grid (like the grid-like street geography of the New York borough of Manhattan) calculated by only taking a vertical and/or horizontal path.

Write a function `int manhattanDistance(Point, Point)` that returns the Manhattan Distance between the two points.

## Rules
- The class `Point` is immutable (its state cannot be changed after instantiation)
- The class `Point` has no Getters
- The class `Point` has no public properties (i.e. the internal state cannot be read from outside the class).
